However, the#   Mac OS Dingbats character set uses the standard control characters#   at 0x00-0x1F and 0x7F.## Notes on Mac OS Dingbats:# -------------------------##   The Mac OS Dingbats encoding shares the script code smRoman#   (0) with the standard Mac OS Roman encoding. To determine if#   the Dingbats encoding is being used, you must check if the#   font name is "Zapf Dingbats".##   The layout of the Dingbats character set is identical to or#   a superset of the layout of the Adobe Zapf Dingbats encoding#   vector.##   The following code points are unused, and are not shown here:#   0x8E-0xA0, 0xF0, 0xFF.## Unicode mapping issues and notes:# ---------------------------------##   The goals in the Apple mappings provided here are:#   - Ensure roundtrip mapping from every character in the Mac OS Dingbats#   character set to Unicode and back#   - Use standard Unicode characters as much as possible, to maximize#   interchangeability of the resulting Unicode text. Whenever possible,#   avoid having content carried by private-use characters.##   To satisfy both goals, we use private use characters to mark variants#   that are similar to a sequence of one or more standard Unicode#   characters.##   Apple has defined a block of 32 corporate characters as "transcoding#   hints." These are used in combination with standard Unicode characters#   to force them to be treated in a special way for mapping to other#   encodings; they have no other effect. Sixteen of these transcoding#   hints are "grouping hints" - they indicate that the next 2-4 Unicode#   characters should be treated as a single entity for transcoding. The#   other sixteen transcoding hints are "variant tags" - they are like#   combining characters, and can follow a standard Unicode (or a sequence#   consisting of a base character and other combining characters) to#   cause it to be treated in a special way for transcoding. These always#   terminate a combining-character sequence.##   The transcoding coding hints used in this mapping table are two#   variant tags:#     0xF87C, 0xF87F#   Since these are combined with standard Unicode characters, some#   characters in the Mac OS Dingbats character set map to a sequence of#   two Unicodes instead of a single Unicode character.##   For example, the Mac OS Dingbats character at 0x88 is a heavy or bold#   variant of LEFT ANGLE BRACKET (the standard mapping is for the#   abstract character at 0x84). So 0x88 is mapped to 0x3008 (LEFT ANGLE#   BRACKET) + 0xF87C (a variant tag).## Details of mapping changes in each version:# -------------------------------------------##   Changes from version n03 to version n05:##   - The mappings for the following Mac OS Dingbats characters#   were changed from single corporate-zone Unicode characters#   to standard Unicode characters:#   0x80-0x81, 0x84-0x87, 0x8A-0x8D.##   - The mappings for the following Mac OS Dingbats characters#   were changed from single corporate-zone Unicode characters#   to combinations of a standard Unicode and a transcoding hint:#   0x82-0x83, 0x88-0x89.###################0x20	0x0020	# SPACE0x21	0x2701	# UPPER BLADE SCISSORS0x22	0x2702	# BLACK SCISSORS0x23	0x2703	# LOWER BLADE SCISSORS0x24	0x2704	# WHITE
